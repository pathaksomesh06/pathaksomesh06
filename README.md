Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Somesh Pathak, and I'm a **Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)** in Enterprise Mobility based in Den Haag, Netherlands. I have a deep-rooted passion for Microsoft Intune and its capabilities to provide scalable, cloud-based enterprise mobility 
management and security solutions.

Being a seasoned IT professional and recognized Microsoft MVP, I've accumulated vast experience in the realm of enterprise mobility, with a special focus on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) through Microsoft Intune. I strive 
to utilize this powerful tool to bolster IT infrastructures, enhance security protocols, and ultimately empower teams to work more efficiently and securely.
